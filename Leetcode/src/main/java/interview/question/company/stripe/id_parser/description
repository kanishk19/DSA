You are given a string representing application IDs in the following format:

Each application ID is prefixed by its length (number of characters in the ID).
The format is: lengthOfApplicationId + APPLICATION_ID + ... + 0 (ends with a 0).
Example:
Input: 10A13414124218B124564356434567430
Output: ["A134141242", "B12456435643456743"]

Part 2:
Filter the application IDs obtained from Part 1 to return only the "whitelisted" application IDs.

Example:
Input: 10A13414124218B124564356434567430, ["A134141242"]
Output: ["A134141242"]
