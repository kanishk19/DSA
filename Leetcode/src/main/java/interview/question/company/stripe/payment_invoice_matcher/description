You are given:
• A payment string
• A list of invoice strings

The payment string is a comma-separated string containing:

The payment ID (e.g., “payment123”)
The payment amount in USD minor units (e.g., $1.00 = 100)
The memo line, which always follows the format “Paying off: {INVOICE_ID}”
Each invoice string is also comma-separated and contains:

The invoice ID
The due date of the invoice (e.g., “2024-01-01”)
The amount due in USD minor units
You need to:
• Parse the payment and invoices.
• Find the invoice mentioned in the memo line.
• Output a formatted string describing the reconciliation.

Input Example:
payment = "payment5,1000,Paying off: invoiceC"
invoices = [
"invoiceA,2024-01-01,100",
"invoiceB,2024-02-01,200",
"invoiceC,2023-01-30,1000"
]

Expected Output:
payment5 pays off 1000 for invoiceC due on 2023-01-30
