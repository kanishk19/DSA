actual statement:
    given arr A. form arr B from multiples of A of infinte length return kth element(1 based indexing) in arr B after sort B.
    note multiple of 2 are 2,4,6,8,10,12....so on like wise
    constraints:
    1<A.length<10^5
    1<k<10^9
    1<A[i]<10^5
    example testcase:
    given A=[2,3,4]
    b=[2,3,4,4,6,6,8,8,9,......upto infinite]
    kthelement=8(1 based indexing]



Given an array A containing positive integers, generate another array B by considering multiples of elements from A infinitely. Sort the resulting array B and find the k-th element (1-based indexing).

For instance, if A = [2, 3, 4], then B would be [2, 3, 4, 4, 6, 6, 8, 8, 9, ...] formed by considering multiples of 2, 3, and 4. After sorting, if k = 8, the output should be the 8th element of the sorted array B.

Constraints:

The length of A is between 1 and 10^5.
The value of k is between 1 and 10^9.
Each element A[i] is between 1 and 10^5.
Example Test Case:

Given A = [2, 3, 4], the array B is generated by considering multiples of 2, 3, and 4. Sorting B results in [2, 3, 4, 4, 6, 6, 8, 8, 9, ...]. If k = 8, the 8th element in the sorted array is 8.
