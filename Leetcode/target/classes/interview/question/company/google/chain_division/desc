You and a friend have received a special gold chain as a gift.
The chain links each have an integer weight, not necessarily the same.
You and your friend must choose one of the links to be removed and provided to charity, after which the chain will be reconnected.
After that, you can choose one place along the chain to split it in two, such that it creates two equally-weighted sections for you and your friend to take home.
For a given input chain (list of link weights), determine if a solution is possible

5 2 1 3 2 7

Output : Yes.

We can give 2 at index 1 to the charity.
The remaining array would be 5 1 3 2 7.
We can divide the remaining array into two parts (5 1 3) & (2 7).
