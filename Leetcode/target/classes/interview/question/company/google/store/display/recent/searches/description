Design a search data structure to store and show the most recent N searches.
If the user doesn't select anything, we should return the top N searches. Given a search string, we should be able to store that search query in the most recently searches.

essentially implement the following 2 methods:
- addSearch(String searchQuery)
- getMostRecentSearches()
